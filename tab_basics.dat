  <!-- baAttrib portal
        Presents a fixed table that consists of the various attributes for the
        character. The "explicit" sortset is used to enforce a hand-numbered
        ordering of the attributes. Since the full list is short enough to always
        be visible, the table has no scroller.

        We use a "headertitle" script to place a suitable title above the table.

        Displays one attribute within the table of attributes. We setup suitable

        an incrementer where the user can assign the value, and an info button that
        provides details on the attribute when the user moves the mouse over it.

  <!-- basics layout
        This layout orchestrates the display of all various visual elements that
        comprise the Basics tab. We have titles above the attributes and skills,
        the attributes and skills tables themselves, a horizontal separator, and
        the table of derived traits.

        Each of these portals and templates is identified as a "reference" by the
        layout. Using references allows distinct instances of portals and templates
        to be re-used within multiple layouts. You can even use the same template
        multiple times within a single layout.

        The visual elements used in the layout are all sized and positioned via
        the "position" script. This script is invoked to setup the dimensions of
        visual elements and trigger the positioning of the contents of those
        elements via the "render" invocation.

        The tab order between items is controlled via the optional "taborder" XML
        attribute on the various portal and template references. Within a template,
        the tab order is dictated by the order the portals are listed within the
        XML. Within a table, the tab order is dictated by the item sequence. The
        "taborder" attribute coordinates the relative sequence of portals and
        templates within the layout. In this layout, the tab order will move down
        the left column and then shift over to the right column.

      ~portal[baAttrib].left = 0
      ~portal[baAttrib].height = height

  <!-- basics panel
        This is the "Basics" panel shown within Hero Lab.

        The "order" attribute dictates the sequence in which the various tabs will
        be displayed. To keep everything well organized, We break the tabs up into
        four logical groupings: (1) traits and creation details, (2) equipment,
        (3) details, and (4) in-play support. Each of these groupings will have a
        three-digit value that starts with the grouping number. Since the Basics
        panel should appear first within the traits group, it has an order of "110".

        As we assign order values, We'll leave gaps in the sequence (e.g. 110, 120,
        etc.). This will allow us to easily change our minds and slip a new panel
        inbetween two existing ones as the data files evolve, without having to go
        through and re-number everything.

        We setup a suitable margin around the edges of the panel. This ensures that
        there is a little bit of spacing from the edges and eliminates the need for
        our positioning scripts to make the appropriate adjustments.

        Like with layouts, panels have a "position" script to setup the dimensions
        of child elements and orchestrate the rendering of their contents. In many
        cases, as with this panel, the default handling of panels will ensure that
        the layouts are properly rendered.

        The panel is assigned a "live" tagexpr so that its visibility can be
        controlled for different types of characters. While not really useful in the
        sample data files, this approach can be quite useful when the data files
        expand to govern creation of widely varying characters, such as vampires vs.
        ghosts vs. mortals in the World of Darkness game system.
